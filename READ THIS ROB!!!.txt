What i couldnt implement was a cutscene where the NPC asks you to kill 5 rats in the 
forest and a 'Congratulations' cutscene.

to kill the rats just collide with them.

As it stands there is no 'WIN' to the game.

Also i credit David Herlihy, 2nd yr multimedia with the creation of the blacksmith NPC 

I could not get the menu to read the back button once the main two buttons were made in active so 
therefore if you you need to go out of the menu you will have to click the back button with a mouse as the 
game is designed for use with a controller

controls are :  Left Analog  = movement(Player and menu)
		Right analog = Look
		Start        = Pause
		'A'          = Jump (Importing of the .fbx of the main character broke this)
